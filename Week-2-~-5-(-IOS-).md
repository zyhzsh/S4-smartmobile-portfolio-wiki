**Final Presentation:** [**Here**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wRElNToZteXhn7ess9vqz8ra8NFr12iL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114335679009072858418&rtpof=true&sd=true)

**1st Iteration**

my knowledge of design thinking is still a bit vague, so the products produced may not fully meet the requirements or misused the research method for different phases. Meanwhile, my groupmate and I haven't found a suitable way to work yet, there are some communication issues at the beginning. Several methods are used for making decisions not really applied in the design thinking process at the 1st iteration.

**2nd Iteration**

After receiving feedback from 1st iteration, I realized the lack of understanding of design thinking. I start to read the leaflet deeply.  The concept became more clear.

**3rd Iteration** 

I felt we are kind of aimless, so try to focus on the design to get more ideas. I started to think and try different designs to give the best design plan.

**4th Iteration**

* Design: Dig into the details and start designing a clickable prototype.
* Concept: Interview and Storyboard: Re-evaluate and position our software.

## Topic: Education

## Persona - [Kara](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zj_kK9AKd25TOIr6IIZ0F5qPInIipHh88PKs6tnWmII/edit?usp=sharing), [Lucas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAuiFBuH5OqZMp4fHLOrOsjjZK2xSRhcf1joMl0Oj3o/edit?usp=sharing)

## 1st Iteration

* **(Problem definition / Concepting --- Empathy) Method: Empathy Map**

  **Introduction :**

  Because my team members and I couldn't think of what kind of application to design, so I decided to start with Persona to get more information and find out the connection with Education.

  ![Empathy_map](uploads/20ff87244054ac9038c59ee4f47b0ff8/Empathy_map.JPG)

  **Result:**

  Getting more information about Kara.
* **(Problem definition / Concepting --- Define)Method WWWWH:**

  **Introduction:**

  For better understanding and getting more ideas for application.

  I was still misusing it to make the decision.

  ![wwwwh](uploads/24514d437fb807a2b31a23274411bf62/wwwwh.JPG)

  **Result:** After analyzing and finding Kara's needs. We are more aware of the needs of this group of people.

  **Conclusion:** This means that we build the user's needs and a few ideas about the app based on the questions and information we ask and then combine the previous information.
* **(Problem definition / Concepting --- Ideation) Method: Lotus blossom**

  **Introduction :**

  We have tried several research methods and we are still not on the same page (decided what kind of application), I sort of misuse this method to make a decision.

  ![Lotus_blossom](uploads/d4abefcd7d2cdea424c5c5febb880761/Lotus_blossom.jpg)

  **Result:** More Ideas about the application

  **Conclusion:** helped us to generate more ideas.
* **(Problem definition / Concepting --- Prototype & Testing)Method: Harris Profile:**

  **Introduction:** Based on the above, we have a preliminary list of the user's needs and some of the application concepts we have come up with. I'll use Harris Profile to make design choices.

**Summary:** The idea about the application is still vague, using this method to evaluate the different aspects of our persona to decide what kind of app is good for her. During the discussion, we decided to make a language learning teaching platform for our persona. It's difficult to come up with a good idea. But finally, we decided to build a teaching platform, which seems an Old-fashioned application. But it's a good starting point for the next iteration.

## 2nd Iteration

### Problem definition / Concepting

**(Problem definition / Concepting --- Empathy)Design Persona:**

**Introduction:** In order to better design the user experience of the application, we decided to start with the design of Persona. First, we modified some of Kara's personal growth background and personality.

![image](uploads/95889a35a4535554e41e943e8c0a5315/image.png) **Result:** Kara's information is enriched.

**Conclusion:** I will combine her personal information with our idea to "Empathy" with her.

* **(Problem definition / Concepting --- Empathy)Method: Design Persona**

  **Introduction:**

  Where there is a student there is a teacher, therefore we create a new persona as the student user for our application.

  ![image](uploads/9332429ba1f2c50889e6e0295643f3f5/image.png)

  **Result:** A new student user persona.

  **Conclusion:** I can use him to proceed to the Empathy phase.
* **(Problem definition / Concepting --- Empathy)Method: Empathy Map**

  **Introduction:**

  I will analyze the reasons why Kara wants to be a teacher to get more information. ![Empathy_Map](uploads/33e25dc3cc145eecddcaad9c70186be3/Empathy_Map.JPG) **Result:** Show the picture above.

  **Conclusion:** After analyzing the specific pain points of users, I can convert them into specific software design problems based on this information.
* **(Problem definition / Concepting --- Define)Method: Problem Tree**

  **Introduction:**

  Combining the previous information and the information given by my teammates, I roughly brainstormed a few types of specific problems, and then roughly classified them. **Result:**\
  ![Problem_Tree](uploads/8c3b49aede9d5be17c3ded2c8781b108/Problem_Tree.png) **Conclusion:** Based on these points, the next step can start ideation for the potential solution.
* **(Problem definition / Concepting --- Ideation)Method: Lotus blossom**

  **Introduction:** Some specific links are not completely organized into text documents. Here I only care about how to solve the problems related to the design of teachers and users. For this reason, I divided the problems into roughly eight levels, and then conducted specific analysis and brainstorming specific solutions to these eight aspects. **Result:** ![LB 2](uploads/8d1c3a0e2733927bf2da4ea9a46216e3/LB-2.jpg) **Conclusion:** Some ideas have not been completely documented, but there are some general ideas about how to design specific user interfaces. The next step can be to start specific design product prototypes for the corresponding testing.
* **(Design --- Prototype&Testing)Method: Clickable Prototype**

  **Introduction:**

  Due to time constraints, I will focus on **how teachers interact with students during the lesson.**

## 3rd Iteration

* **(Problem definition / Concepting --- Empathy) Method: Empathy Prototype**

  **Introduction:**

  After going through the last iteration, we have a preliminary design for how teacher users interact with the app when she was teaching. But considering the limitations of mobile devices (screen size), we need to think about more possibilities for this. Therefore, we may need to simulate and think about the potential demand that Kara might generate in the online lesson. **Result:** ![Prototype_empathy](uploads/b734f839a34c595bd8fa835ce3a59bf8/Prototype_empathy.png) **Conclusion:** Base on the Empathy prototype result, I can start designing the wireframe.
* **(Design --- Define) Method: Wireframe** **Introduction:** Start to think about the user interface for teacher users.\
  \*\*Result: \*\*\
  ![Kara-Wireframe](uploads/54cb54feec9c8f131597d6a1362ac6cf/Kara-Wireframe.png) ![Kara-Wireframe-2](uploads/0fa816328f557c7f5b653fcf7dc2f453/Kara-Wireframe-2.png) **Conclusion:** I designed 4 different wireframes for the teacher user, but then I realized, some of the features or buttons were still not clear on the student side. To maintain the consistency of the design, we need to start thinking about the design for the student user.
* **(Problem definition / Concepting --- Empathy)Method: Emoji Story** **Introduction:** Start to empathy with Lucas.. \

## 4th Iteration

* **(Problem definition / Concepting --- Empathy) Method: Interview**

  **Introduction:**

  After receiving the previous round of feedback, we have enough information to start the design. But the concept is still not solid enough, therefore this iteration I start to re-evaluate our concept and redesign the application for users.

  **Result:** 
  * Interview Question:\

  Online education has its inherent shortcoming that is the lack of feedback. Feedback is the key, therefore to help teachers teach better, we provide more tools and plug-ins to help teachers complete the courseware. Students can easily interact with the teacher through the device during class. Teachers can also get feedback from students in this way. This way of interaction also strengthens the connection between teachers and students...
* **(Concepting --- Prototype) Method: Storyboard** **Introduction:** \
  To re-evaluated our design of application. \

The reasons for becoming a teacher may vary. But as teachers, they hope they can help students. For this reason, the relationship between students and teachers should not be limited to the teaching of knowledge, but should also be reflected in more aspects.
